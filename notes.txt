const app = express()
(async () => {
    try{
       await mongoose.connect(`${process.env.MONGODB_URI}/${DB_NAME}`)
       // this is app.on which is listner 
       app.on("err", (error)  =>{
            console.log("ERROR: ", error);
            throw error
        })

        app.listen(process.env.PORT, () =>{
            console.log(`App is Listening at port ${process.env.PORT}`)
        })

    }catch(err){
        console.error("ERROR:", error)
        throw err
